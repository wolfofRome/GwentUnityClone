# About this project

This is a fan remake of The Witcher 3's famous card game Gwent.
I'm fully aware that an official standalone version of Gwent is on steam. However I'm enthusiastic about the older version of Gwent and its mechanics which is one of the reasons I got so immersed in The Witcher 3 world. Therefore, here's the original version made nearly from scratch in Unity game engine.

I got the card assets from here: [Gwent Cards Repository (game rules are here if you're unfamiliar)](https://github.com/matt77hias/Gwent)

Every other asset I made myself using Adobe Photoshop.

Some of them are clunky but the gameplay should be 100% bug-free.

This game supports full deck editing and has a an AI using a Monsters decks.

Sorry, no multiplayer :/ (yet)
