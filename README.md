# GwentUnityClone
 The Witcher 3 card game (Implemented with Unity engine)
 

# About this project

This is a fan remake of The Witcher 3's famous card game Gwent.
I'm fully aware that an official standalone version of Gwent is on steam. However I'm enthusiastic about the older version of Gwent and its mechanics which is one of the reasons I got so immersed in The Witcher 3 world. Therefore, here's the original version made nearly from scratch in Unity game engine.


Every other asset I made myself using Adobe Photoshop.

Some of them are clunky but the gameplay should be 100% bug-free.

This game supports full deck editing and has a an AI using a Monsters decks.

Sorry, no multiplayer :/ (yet)

##### (If the installer fails, simply disable any antivirus software as it is made without a digital license using Inno Setup)

# Credits:
It naturally goes without saying, but I don't claim ownership of the game idea, the card assets or any other materials related to The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, all credits goes to the owners CD PROJEKT RED.
